# StockMarket_Project

1. Clean the data
2. SQL ( we would need to break into multiple csv files for the multiple visualization)
3. Flask ( creating a website)
4. Machine learning
(5) We can use the  API to get the current price we have time


I believe we have enough data that we need but we need to think how we are going to use them. In order to work on step 2 SQL, we should think what data (column) combinations are we using in the visualization. Before discussing about this on the next meeting, please research on your own what visualization should we use and what data is required for that visualization.
