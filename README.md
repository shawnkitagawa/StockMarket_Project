#Finish cleaning the income statement data and merge first and second data into one 2/1/23


1. Clean the data
Income statement
(Shawn Kitagawa)

balance statement 





2. SQL ( we would need to break into multiple csv files for the multiple visualization)
3. Flask ( creating a website)
4. Machine learning
(5) We can use the  API to get the current price we have time


I believe we have enough data that we need but we need to think how we are going to use them. In order to work on step 1 and 2, we need to think what data (column) combinations are we using in the visualization.
